# Nabs.UnitTests Playbook

In this playbook we provide guidance that helps you identify the runbook to suit the type of unit test you are about the write. The runbooks we provide will guide teams and individuals through setting up unit tests.

Target Audience
- Testers
- Test leads
- Developers
- Team leads
- Architects
- Analysts

There are two basic runbooks that should be employed at all times:
- Standard Unit Test Method Template Runbook
- Output Logging Unit Test Runbook

In addition one or more of the following runbooks can also be employed dependent on the testing tactics required for your scenario:

1. There is only one scenario my unit tests will cover.
1. The are multiple scenarios my unit test will cover.
1. Do you need to provide services to your unit test that are best set up through dependency injection or mocks?
1. Do you need to load test data for each test?
1. Do you need to bootstrap a data store prior to running the test?

Runbook | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
---|---|---|---|---|---
Single-scenario Unit Test Runbook | N | Y | N | N | N
Multi-scenario Unit Test Runbook | N | N | Y | N | N
Service Collection Unit Test Runbook | N | N | Y | N | N
Scenario Data Unit Test Runbook | N | N | N | Y | N
Bootstrap Data Unit Test Runbook | N | N | N | N | Y

You will note that you should always excute the _Output Logging Unit Test Runbook_.

## Standard Unit Test Method Template Runbook

All tests should follow a basic convention. We recommend that each test method is broken down into the following basic parts.
- Arrange - set up the variables for the inputs to the test.
- Act - perfo
- Assert

Example:
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Multiply_A_and_B__Success()
{
    //Arrange
    const int a = 2;
    const int b = 2;
    const int expected = 4;
    
    //Act
    const int actual = MathUtils.Multiply(a, b);

    //Assert
    actual.Should().Be(expected);
}
```

## Output Logging Unit Test Runbook

All tests should provide enough information to the observer to validate the the necessary steps have been executed. This is achieved by providing outputs that will be displayed in the ___Test Details Summary___ window of the test runner in the _Visual Studio IDE_.

1. Create a class for your unit tests. E.g. `SimpleTestWithOutputLogginUnitTests.cs`
1. Inherit from `Nabs.Tests.TestBase`.
1. Add you test methods.
1. You can use the `nabsTestFact` code snippet to generate the method stub.
1. Use the following convenience methods to output your messages:
    - `OutputScenario`
    - `OutputStep`

Example:
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Outputs__Success()
{
    OutputScenario();
    OutputStep("#1");
    OutputStep("#2");

    //Manually view the Test Details Summary output window for results.
}
```
The _Test Details Summary_ window will display the following output:
```text
Standard Output:â€‰
    [SimpleTestWithOutputLoggingUnitTests] is constructing...
    =========================================================
    [Outputs__Success] - Scenario: default
    Step: #1
    Step: #2
    ===================================================
    [SimpleTestWithOutputLoggingUnitTests] is disposed!
```


## Single-scenario Data Unit Test Runbook

1. Create your test method stub. You can use the `nabsTestFact` code snippet to generate the method stub.
1. Add the xUnit `Fact`Attribute.
1. Implement your test method.

## Multi-scenario Data Unit Test Runbook

1. Create your test method stub. You can use the `nabsTestTheory` code snippet to generate the method stub.
1. Add the xUnit `Theory`Attribute.
1. Implement your test method.

## Scenario Data From Json Unit Test Runbook


## Service Collection Unit Test Runbook


## Bootstrap Data Unit Test Runbook





Providing a structured approach to testing is one of the most valuable aspects to any software development project.

The goal of this library is to provide a starting point for individuals and teams to get their tests consistently setup.

## Classes

### Abstractions
- `TestFixtureBase`
- `TestBase`
- `TestBase<TTestFixture>`

### Implementations
- `AppSettingsTestFixture`

## Notes

### `TestFixtureBase`

Sets up the configuration and service scope for the test class.

Two virtual methods are provided to:
- `ConfigureConfiguration` to add additional configuration providors to to the `IConfigurationBuilder`.
- `ConfigureServices` to add dependencies to the `IServiceCollection`.

We also provide a basic implementation in the form of `AppSettingsTestFixture` which adds `appsettings.json` configuration handling.


### `TestBase`
