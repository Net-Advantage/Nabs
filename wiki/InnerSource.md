# Inner Source

It should never be our intention that any one person owns any single part of the software.

The idea behind inner source is that the software is collectively owned and that anyone can contribute to the improvement of any part of the system given the following conditions:

- They follow the formal process to clarify and plan work.
- Any investigative work that is out of band (I.e.: not properly clarified and planned) is on the developer's own clock and must not interfere with already scheduled work assigned to the individual.
- Out of band work that is ultimately accepted should be rewarded based on the value derived from the input.
